Implementation of a Text Mining API using the Django framework with OpenAI's LLM.

Features of the Text Mining API include:
- Information Extraction: The API can automatically detect significant names, dates, places, and other pertinent elements within text.
- Sentiment Analysis: It determines the emotional tone of the text (positive, neutral, negative), which can be valuable for analyzing consumer reviews, social media, and other sources.
- Text Summarization: It generates concise versions of lengthy texts while preserving the core content of the original.

Task Requirements:
1) The language for queries and responses must be English.
2) Use the OpenAI model, gpt-3.5-turbo.
